function [ f0 ] = silent_frame_classification(xframes, f0)

%silent frame classification in music based on signal energy/spectral flatness
%xframes - signal divided into buffers/frames
%f0 - frequencies (one for each frame)

%this method works great for non-noisy signals but fails otherwise
nframes = size(xframes,1);
N = size(xframes,2);

%this method works for noisy signals - find PSD of signal, and its spectral flatness
%the assumption is that silent frames have only noise and therefore a flat
%power spectrum

energy = zeros(1,nframes);

for i = 1:nframes
    [psdw, w] = pwelch(xframes(i,:)); 
    %this method works in case the signal isn't noisy.
    energy(i) = 20*log10(sum(xframes(i,:).^2));
    %the spectral flatness method works only if signal is noisy
    spectral_flatness(i) = geomean(psdw)/mean(psdw);
